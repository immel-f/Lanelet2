/**
 * @brief Base class of all local instance labels
 *
 * An instance is one label of a MapData object. It is created from one map element (its mapID()) and is then
 * brought into the local reference frame by process(), which runs the following pipeline:
 * 1. **cut**: the raw geometry is clipped to the local bounding box (see cutLineString())
 * 2. **transform**: the clipped geometry is moved into the bounding box frame (see transformLineString())
 * 3. **resample**: the transformed geometry is resampled to a fixed number of points (see resampleLineString()),
 *    unless resampling was disabled by passing nPoints < 2
 *
 * The results of all three stages are kept, see LineStringInstance. Because clipping can split one line into
 * several disjoint pieces, every stage stores a *list* of line strings, not a single one.
 *
 * @note An instance is only meaningful after process() has been called on it - MapData::processAll() does this
 * for every instance it holds.
